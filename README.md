## Extra notes
### Viewing Jupyter notebooks
Sometimes, if you try to view a Jupyter notebook (i.e. `.ipynb` file) in GitHub, the page does not load - it just says "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?". If this happens, another way to view the notebook is using the `nbviewer` website. Just paste the GitHub URL in the box on the main screen here: <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>
